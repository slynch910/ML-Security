# Random Forest Classifier ML Model on NSL-KDD # 

This code uses a random forest classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset to create a model that can predict whether a network connection is benign or malicious. The model is then used to predict the network connections in the NSL-KDD test dataset. The model is then evaluated using the F1 score and the confusion matrix.
